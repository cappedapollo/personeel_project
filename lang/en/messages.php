An overview of the competency categories and associated competencies included in the PB Online software can be found below. You can toggle these ON or OFF per employee in the employee overview (gray gear icon).</p>

<p><b>What are competencies?</b><br/>
A competence is an observable combination of knowledge, skills, attitude and/or personal characteristics (personal qualities) with which certain goals are achieved in a work situation. A competence is a combination of three things:<br/>
- Knowledge (information and experience)<br/>
- Skills (physical and mental actions that someone has masters well, such as: touch typing, CO2 welding, oral communication in Spanish, leadership, negotiating skills, driving a truck, etc.)<br/>
- Character traits.</p>

<p><b>Use of competencies in PB Online</b><br/>
In PB Online, employee performance is reviewed on competences as well as objectives. The system includes 70 competencies from which to choose.</p>

<p><b>Competency Categories</b><br/>
The competencies in PB Online are divided into 7 categories:<br/>
1. Management & Developing Others<br/>
2. Technical knowledge and expertise<br/>
3. Planning & Organization<br/>
4. Communication & Collaboration<br/>
5. Problem-solving ability<br/>
6. Performance & Quality<br/>
7. Motivation & Personal Growth</p>

<p><b>Tips for using competencies:</b><br/>
- An organization can choose to use core competencies. These are the competencies that apply to all employees of that organization and are also included in the annual assessment for each position.<br/>
- Some companies find it easy to leave all 70 competencies ON for everyone and assess all employees in the organization on all 70 competencies. The advantage of this is that employees receive very detailed feedback from their managers on all kinds of competencies.<br/>
- Other companies choose to select only a few competencies from each competency category for the assessment of each employee. The advantage of this is that the evaluations can be carried out faster.<br/>
- The 7 competency categories, each with 10 competencies, are included in the system. A company could add its own competencies. These additional competencies can be added as (competence) objectives in the employee overview in the in the Objectives section (gray gear icon).</p>
